# Data Models

Up to this point, we have mostly focused on _describing_ our data. What if we want to say more about the _processes_ unfolding? In this week, we look at data modelling. We will examine linear and non-linear models, their benefits, and some potential drawbacks. 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r datamodels}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r datamodels2, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
