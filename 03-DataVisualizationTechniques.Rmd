# Data Visualization Techniques

Data visualization is an important, and sometimes overlooked, aspect of social science. This week, we go back to the visualization techniques of Du Bois, which remind us that data science long predates the current era of ``big data." 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r vizualization, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
