# Prediction, Machine Learning, and AI

It's easy to understand things that have already happened, but what about future events? A new ``school" of data science, which has gained popularity in recent years, seeks not just to model relationships, but to _predict_ outcomes. We'll look at what this means for the social sciences. 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r prediction}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r machine, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
