# Networks

Sometimes, we wish to measure or display how observations are linked to each other. For instance, we might want to analyze a web of social interactions, or migration flows between many entities. In these times, network analysis is what we need. We will look at some applications of networks in sociology, and cover basic ways to visualize and analyze network data. 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r net}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r works, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
